The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Challenges`

- This project team has ran into issues while using apollo react hooks
- For example, when implementing useMutation and useQuery the page will no longer load.
- Currently, we have login functionality and sign-up functionality commented out.

- The useMutation syntax is the same as seen in up to date documentation, and once we can use the useMutation hook, in theory, 
  login/sign-up functionality should work.
